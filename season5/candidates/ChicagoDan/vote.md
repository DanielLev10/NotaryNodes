Funds gained from this opportunity I will keep them within the Komodo community and invest in Phantasia project development. The Phantasia project is currently in the design phase and will need additional resources when moved into development. Throughout the ideation phase of the Phantasia project many members of the Komodo community were consulted and provided input into the project.
